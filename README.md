# Rukkola DevJobs App

Happy to present a new, energetic and beautiful web service for finding a new job in programming. Users are presented with two search bars and a filter that pinpoints the kind of job clients would like to have in the future. The employer's side offers a template for filling out requirements for potential specialists. Worth pointing out that the application is adapted for phones! :computer: / :iphone:.

We hope the service will help users find the job that they want! You can check it out [here](https://rukkola.netlify.app/jobs) or in the description of this project on the github. The project is non-commercial and includes hardcode!
